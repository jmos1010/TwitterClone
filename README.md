# TwitterClone

This project was started as a way of learning new iOS development concepts.
It was created by following a Udemy course.

## Description

This is functional Twitter clone built fully programmatically using MVVM architecture and based on Firebase Realtime Database.

You can:
- create a new user or login with an existing one
- post a tweet or reply to someone's tweet
- mention someone with their @username in tweet caption and that user will get notification
- click on mentioned @username in tweet caption and go to their profile page
- see user's tweets, replies and likes on ther profile page
- like a tweet and tweet's owner will get notification
- follow a user to get his tweets in your feed
- edit your existing profile (change name, username, bio or profile image)
- get notified when somone follows you (and follow him back directly from notification page)

### While building this app I have learned how to...
- build UI fully programmatically; create custom views and use AutoLayout
- implement MVVM architecture at basic level
- delegate actions using protocols
- create custom subclasses and reuse code
- dynamically size collection view cells 
- create custom ActionSheet launcher
- use DateFormatter and DateComponentsFormatter
- use UIImagePickerController, UISearchController and UIAlertController
- register and authenticate users with Firebase
- communicate with Realtime Database (read/write)
- upload image to Firebase Storage
- use CocoaPods
- and more...
